# search-gz-python
This little script will open gz file and allow you to search for specific string within the file. My intend was not to allways use zgrep etc in order to find some specific string within the file. 

Requirements
- python 2.7+

# how to use it

python search-gz-python.py

Input Filepath: add path to the file you are trying to open. If search-gz-python is in same location then name of the file is just fine.


Enter Search: enter the search string you want to display only, or just hit enter and it will show you everything within that gz file.
